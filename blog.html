            <h3 class=" question">1. Differences between local storage VS session storage</h3>
            <p class="answer"> The Main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that localStorage data
                does
                not expire,
                whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends</p>

            <h3 class=" question">2. Differences between global scope VS block scope in javascript</h3>
            <p class="answer"> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops
                or
                within a function, are
                accessible within that particular condition or loop.In simple word the variables declared inside the
                curly
                braces are called as within block scope whereas Global scoped variables can be accessed from anywhere in
                a
                JavaScript program. Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside
                a
                block. They all have Global Scope</p>

            <h3 class=" question">3. How js event loop works</h3>
            <p class="answer"> The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous
                programming.It monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop
                will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it
