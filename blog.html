        <h3 class=" question">1. Differences between local storage VS session storage</h3>
        <p class="answer"> The Main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that localStorage data does
            not expire,
            whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends</p>
        <h3 class=" question">2. Differences between global scope VS block scope in javascript</h3>
        <p class="answer"> A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops or
            within a function, are
            accessible within that particular condition or loop.In simple word the variables declared inside the curly
            braces are called as within block scope whereas Global scoped variables can be accessed from anywhere in a
            JavaScript program. Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a
            block. They all have Global Scope</p>
